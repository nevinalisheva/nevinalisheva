# Nevin Alisheva - Junior Full Stack Developer

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a junior full stack developer currently in training, with a passion for building web and mobile applications.

I have completed a 5-month bootcamp, where I gained foundational skills in JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Next.js and other modern libraries and frameworks. My personal projects and coursework demonstrate my ability to take on new challenges and deliver high-quality solutions.

On this profile, you'll find a variety of projects that I've worked on, including:

- **NEMURA**: A web application that allows you to search for any TV show and get detailed information about its actors, seasons, episodes, and overall rating.
- **Christmas in Berlin**: A mobile-only web app that showcases Christmas markets in your district and features an advent calendar for a special surprise.
- **Berlinale FMA**: A fleet management application designed for Berlinale workers, professionals and accredited visitors to the festival.

Feel free to take a look around, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project.
